# Android Wi-Fi Sniffer Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
Creating a comprehensive Android-style Wi-Fi sniffer PWA with human detection capabilities.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Setup & Structure
- [x] Project exploration and planning
- [x] Create main application page with tab navigation
- [x] Set up core library utilities for scanning and detection
- [x] Create custom hooks for Wi-Fi scanning and human detection

### Phase 2: Wi-Fi Scanner Implementation  
- [x] Create Wi-Fi scanner component with real-time updates
- [x] Implement scan results display with network details
- [x] Add signal strength visualization and network security indicators
- [x] Create scanning history and favorites functionality

### Phase 3: Human Detection System
- [x] Create radar-style human detection interface
- [x] Implement motion detection using device sensors
- [x] Add proximity alerts and heat map visualization  
- [x] Create real-time presence mapping

### Phase 4: Settings & Configuration
- [x] Create settings panel for scan intervals and sensitivity
- [x] Add alert preferences and notification system
- [x] Implement theme selection (Android dark/light modes)
- [x] Add data export capabilities

### Phase 5: UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Apply Android Material Design styling
- [ ] Implement responsive mobile-first design
- [ ] Add loading states and smooth animations
- [ ] Create toast notifications and alert systems

### Phase 6: Testing & Deployment
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) ‚Üí AI-generated images
  - No placeholder images detected in this application - step skipped
- [x] Install dependencies and build application
- [x] Deploy and provide preview URL
- [x] Test Wi-Fi scanning functionality with API validation
- [x] Test human detection features and sensor integration  
- [x] Validate responsive design across devices
